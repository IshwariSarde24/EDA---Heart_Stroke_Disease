# EDA on Heart_Stroke_Disease #

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on heart stroke disease typically involves examining various factors related to cardiovascular health to identify 
patterns, correlations, and potential predictors of stroke risk. Here's a general outline of what you might include in your EDA:

**1) Data Collection:** Gather a comprehensive dataset containing relevant variables such as age, gender, hypertension,heart_disease	ever_married,work_type,Residence_type,avg_glucose_level,bmi,
   smoking_status,stroke and any other factors known to influence heart health. ðŸ“Š


**2)Data Cleaning:** Perform necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and ensuring data consistency.ðŸ§¹

**3)Descriptive Statistics:** Compute summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for each variable to gain an overview of the dataset's characteristics.ðŸ“ˆ

**4) Visualization:** Create informative visualizations such as scatter plots, heatmaps, and bar charts etc. to illustrate patterns and relationships within the data.
   Visualizations can often reveal insights that may not be apparent from numerical summaries alone. ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆðŸ“‰
